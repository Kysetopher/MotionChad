# AGENT Guidelines

This repository hosts **Wishh.ai**, an AI-enhanced knowledge and chat platform built with Next.js, React 18, Supabase, and OpenAI.

When summarizing or describing the project, highlight these points:

- Wishh.ai promotes an **AI-first**, privacy-focused productivity assistant that organizes information into **structured, retrievable insights**.
- Streaming chat suggestions link directly to note-like **"Reveries"** that users can drag and drop.
- Supabase powers real-time updates and authentication, while customizable agents leverage OpenAI models.
- The stack also includes Stripe for subscriptions, Neo4j for graph data, and a modern editor built on the Plate framework.

Keep descriptions concise and reference the app name exactly as "Wishh.ai." Contributors can start by running `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
